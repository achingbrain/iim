 * @example Use the latest version of Kubo
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ iim use kubo
 * âœ” selected kubo version 0.24.0
 * âœ” installed kubo 0.24.0
 * âœ” installed binary at /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.24.0/ipfs
 * âœ” initialized IPFS at /Users/alan/.iim/kubo@0.24.0
 * âœ” configured IPFS
 * âœ” symlinked /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.24.0/ipfs -> /Users/alan/.iim/dists/current
 * âœ” symlinked /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.24.0/ipfs -> /usr/local/bin/ipfs
 * ðŸš€ IPFS is ready to use
 *
 * $ ipfs version
 * kubo version: 0.24.0
 * ```
 *
 * @example Use Kubo at version 0.23.0
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ iim use kubo 0.23
 * âœ” selected kubo version 0.23.0
 * âœ” installed kubo 0.23.0
 * âœ” installed binary at /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.23.0/ipfs
 * âœ” initialized IPFS at /Users/alan/.iim/kubo@0.23.0
 * âœ” configured IPFS
 * âœ” symlinked /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.23.0/ipfs -> /Users/alan/.iim/dists/current
 * âœ” symlinked /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.23.0/ipfs -> /usr/local/bin/ipfs
 * ðŸš€ IPFS is ready to use
 *
 * $ ipfs version
 * kubo version: 0.24.0
 *```
 *
 * ## How does it work?
 *
 * A new repo is created and used for each implementation/version combination at `~/.iim/kubo@0.24.0`, for example.
 *
 * Adds a symlink at `/usr/local/bin/ipfs` that points to a script that runs IPFS with `IPFS_PATH` set to `~/.iim/kubo@0.24.0`.
 *
 * IPFS is installed to `~/.iim/dists/kubo@0.24.0/node_modules/ipfs` or `~/.iim/dists/go-ipfs@0.4.18/node_modules/go-ipfs-dep` for example.
 *
 * ## Common issues
 *
 * ### Failed to symlink
 *
 * Looks like this:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ iim use kubo
 * âœ” selected kubo version 0.4.18
 * âœ” installed kubo 0.4.18
 * âœ” installed binary at /home/dave/.iim/dists/kubo@0.4.18/ipfs
 * âœ” initialized IPFS at /home/dave/.iim/kubo@0.4.18
 * âœ” symlinked /home/dave/.iim/dists/kubo@0.4.18/ipfs -> /home/dave/.iim/dists/current
 * âœ– failed to symlink /home/dave/.iim/dists/kubo@0.4.18/ipfs -> /usr/local/bin/ipfs
 * ðŸ’¥ failed to link binary at /usr/local/bin/ipfs, try running sudo iim link
 * ```
 *
 * Don't worry! Mostly everything worked fine - you just don't have permission to write to `/usr/local/bin`! Just run `sudo iim link` and it'll try again to create that symlink.
 *
 * Feel free to dive in! [Open an issue](https://github.com/alanshaw/iim/issues/new) or submit PRs.
